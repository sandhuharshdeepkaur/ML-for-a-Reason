**1. What is Machine Learning?**

"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."-Arthur Samuel(1959)

"Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to _learn_ from experience 'E' with respect to some task 'T' and some performance 'P' if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."- Tom Mitchell(1998)

"Machine Learning is the science or the art of programming computers so they can learn from data."- Aurélien Géron(2017)

In detail:

"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It is focused on teaching computers to learn from data and to improve with experience – instead of being explicitly programmed to do so. In machine learning, algorithms are trained to find patterns and correlations in large data sets and to make the best decisions and predictions based on that analysis. Machine learning applications improve with use and become more accurate the more data they have access to. Applications of machine learning are all around us –in our homes, our shopping carts, our entertainment media, and our healthcare."


**2. Why should we study Machine Learning?**

As we all know ML is an application of Artificial Intelligence. It
allows software applications to become accurate in predicting outcomes. ML focuses on the development of computer programs, and the primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention.

Even Google says “Machine Learning is the future,” and the future of Machine Learning is going to be very bright. As humans become more addicted to machines, we’re witnesses to a new revolution that’s taking over the world, and that is going to be the future of Machine Learning.

This field intensively deals with mathematics, for analysis of data and algorithms. 'You' should be quite a suitable candidate yourself (if you paid enough attention in the maths classes)! A good mathematical background is a must and we engineers definitely excel at that! If you have had a mathematical background at school and covered engineering mathematics, you're good to go! Maybe you could just brush up the topics.

**3. Why Is Machine Learning Important?**

Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data.
Data is the lifeblood of all business. Data-driven decisions increasingly make the difference between keeping up with competition or falling further behind. Machine learning can be the key to unlocking the value of corporate and customer data and enacting decisions that keep a company ahead of the competition.

**4. How Does Machine Learning Work?**

Machine learning is made up of three parts:

-The computational algorithm at the core of making determinations.

-Variables and features that make up the decision.

-Base knowledge for which the answer is known that enables (trains) the system to learn.


**5. How to start learning Machine Learning?**

Step 1 – Understand the Prerequisites:

In case you are a genius, you could start Machine Learning directly but normally, there are some prerequisites that you need to know which include:

(a) Learn Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus

(b) Learn Statistics

(c) Learn Python

Step 2 – Learn Various Machine Learning Concepts:

(a) Terminologies of Machine Learning

(b) Types of Machine Learning

(c) Practise Machine Learning

(d) Finding resources for Learning Machine Learning
