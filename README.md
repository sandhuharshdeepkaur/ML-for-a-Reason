What is Machine Learning?

"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."-Arthur Samuel(1959)

"Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience 'E' with respect to some task 'T' and some performance 'P' if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."- Tom Mitchell(1998)

"Machine Learning is the science or the art of programming computers so they can learn from data."- Aurélien Géron(2017)

In detail:

"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It is focused on teaching computers to learn from data and to improve with experience – instead of being explicitly programmed to do so. In machine learning, algorithms are trained to find patterns and correlations in large data sets and to make the best decisions and predictions based on that analysis. Machine learning applications improve with use and become more accurate the more data they have access to. Applications of machine learning are all around us –in our homes, our shopping carts, our entertainment media, and our healthcare."
